# 191 — Tactician: challenge-level game-playing AI (umbrella)

**Goal:** an AI opponent that genuinely challenges human players with any army vs any army,
built as a ladder of shippable bots: evaluation-driven heuristics (A) -> MCTS over macro-actions
(B) -> learned value function (C) -> optional self-improvement loop (D).

**Design authority:** `docs/ai-agent-plan.md` — architecture, standing decisions (D1-D6),
invariants (G1-G12), stop-and-ask triggers, per-slice specs, gates, and the macro-action
vocabulary (Appendix A, awaiting Chris's edit). This file is the running ledger; the plan doc is
the spec. Keep both current (plan G10).

**Prerequisites:** #192 (structured game result), #193 (determinism/seeding), #194 (FdgLab
harness). Order: any, but all three before Phase A. Related: #066 (AI resolver legality tests),
#168 (rule-load diagnostics surfacing), #170 (solo-rules deploy packing — baseline hygiene).

**Standing authorizations (Chris, 2026-07-09):** engine submodule modification within
`Ai/Tactician/` + the named P/B seams; new project `FdgLab/` in this repo; Python+ONNX stack.
Solo-rules bot behavior is frozen (benchmark baseline) — refactors sharing its machinery need
pin tests.

## Notes (newest first)

**2026-07-10 — A4-1 GATE + post-#199 baseline recorded.** Baseline v2 (solo-vs-solo, fixed engine,
36x100, seeds 1000+): hash `CC04AE4A5C713492` - THE frozen solo reference now (v1's
`3AC9C6FA0B50D590` was pre-#199). A4-1 gate (tactician-vs-solo, 36x50, seeds 3000+): hash
`94AA56B0A094DAD0`. **Mirror average 52.75% for the Tactician** (Robot Legions 64, Hives 59,
Dwarfs 56, HDF 52, BB 51, HEF 50, Orks 48, Dark Elf 42; N=50 each, so single-mirror noise ~7pp,
average ~2.5pp) - the small positive nudge expected from activation order alone; movement is
still solo. Faults 4/1800: three #207-class (consolidation standoff/move-through, all Dark Elf
transport games) + one 120s watchdog on a Hives-DarkElf game (baseline showed legit 2k games
reach 103s - pool runs should use --timeout 240; noted). Cross-matchup rows mix army strength
with profile and are not read as profile signal. NEXT: A4-2 (action+movement onto the
MacroActionGenerator) - Chris authorized continuing overnight; then A4-3 (shooting/melee targets).


**2026-07-09 — A4-1 SHIPPED (activation order + request split); #199 FIXED; first pool baseline.**
A4-1: `ChooseUnitToActivateRequest` split out per Chris's call (type dispatch - which immediately
caught the string version matching Instructions vs the auto-generated TaskName: it would have
silently no-opped); `DerivedRequestAdapter` forwards to existing base-type resolvers in all three
sets, GUI canvas dialog unchanged (shared instance - Chris to eyeball next GUI session);
`TacticianRegistry` = own resolvers over a solo fallback; urgency scoring (value-weighted kill +
flip + threat, weights in TacticianWeights). A0 identity pin retired per its own instructions;
3 behavioral tests replace it. Solo hashes identical (split is behavior-neutral).
**#199 fixed** (Chris-authorized): the float-identity trio in AssignWoundsResults - guard compared
RemainingWoundsBinding against its own double-rounded round-trip; exact-equality finish check;
ULP residues as "room". WoundEpsilon (1e-4) + one capacity formula; four-seed graveyard pinned +
mutation-verified. Suite 1518/1518.
**First 2k pool baseline (solo-vs-solo, 36 matchups x 100, realistic dice, PRE-#199 build):**
hash `3AC9C6FA0B50D590`, 2.79 games/s (10k/hour), mean 5.7s/game, mirrors ~48-52%, real archetype
signal (Hives 80% over elite shooting, HEF casters 64% over Hives). 7 faults / 3600 (~0.2%) - NONE
were #199 (realistic dice): two NEW classes filed as **#207** (AI standoff-violating moves, Dark
Elf transport list, rect-base geometry suspected - kin of #206) and **#208** (#197's triggered
moves lack the G3 validate-or-decline ladder). Baseline + A4-1 gate re-running on the fixed build;
gate numbers land in the next entry.

**2026-07-09 — #200 + #203 FIXED (Chris-authorized engine-core changes); POOL 8/8 GREEN.**
#203 first (its verification needed #200's livelock alive): Task.Yield at the activation boundary
+ Choose Action entry - the livelock then idled to a clean watchdog Fault at DEFAULT stacks
instead of killing the process; bench hashes unchanged on both matrices (outcome-neutral). Then
#200: instrumentation of the bounce branch revealed the real state - the Orc Bikers' Rocket-Mod
is Limited+Deadly and SPENT, and Deadly-first gating ran before Limited-spent gating, so the
empty rocket locked out every other weapon while the Shoot gate (no Deadly gating) said
"fireable". Fix: gating order swapped AND gate/stage now share one pipeline (ApplyTargetGating)
so they can never disagree again; 2 regression pins. Orks mirror now plays 4 full rounds (3.5s).
**All 8 pool mirrors complete**; suite 1511/1511; builtin hashes stable (pool-army trajectories
legitimately shifted - wrongly-locked-out units now shoot). Both items archived. The pool is
ready for A4's first benchmark baseline. Also filed at Chris's request: #204 (save-roll beats
for Rending vs non-Rending groups pace too close together - presentation only).

**2026-07-09 — BENCHMARK POOL DELIVERED by Chris; 7/8 validated; #200/#203 filed off the 8th.**
Eight 2k armies now in `FdgLab/armies/` (moved out of the engine submodule per D3): Alien Hives
horde melee, Battle Brothers elite shooting, Dark Elf Raiders transport, Dwarf Guilds
ambush/scout, High Elf Fleets caster, HDF tough/vehicle, Orks horde mixed, Robot Legions mixed.
**Throughput (G6, measured):** 2k mirrors run 1.4-2.5s wall each, 200-420 decisions - barely
above the tiny test armies; the 5-15x slowdown fear was wrong; Phase C/D volumes are unthreatened.
7/8 play clean full-length mirrors with real objective scores. The Orks mirror exposed two
engine bugs, filed: **#200** (Choose Action offers Shoot with zero fireable targets ->
deterministic AI livelocks; GetCanShoot lacks the target gate GetCanCast already has) and
**#203** (stage transitions chain synchronously; stack depth grows with game length; the loop -
and eventually any long game - kills the process with an uncatchable StackOverflow;
DOTNET_DefaultStackSize=0x4000000 is the lab's interim shield). Both fixes are engine-core
(outside Ai/Tactician) -> awaiting Chris's go per D2. Pool baseline matrix + A4 start once #200
is resolved (or run 7-army in the interim).

**2026-07-09 — A3c-2 DONE; A3 COMPLETE (all of A3a/b/c verified).** M11 MoveToCast (spell-token
holders + army spells via TableState.Armies; goal just inside the best affordable spell's range
of its affinity target; Self-affinity skipped; LoS not modeled - recorded; one candidate per
activation) and M12 DeliverCargo (loaded transports - IsTransport + GetOccupants - route toward
the nearest unowned objective as the cargo-plan proxy) complete the confirmed vocabulary. Float-
margin bug fixed on the way: movers take the epsilon, validators keep the full budget (the
ResolverGuide gotcha, caught by the DeliverCargo test at exactly one ladder halving). **The A3
feasibility gate metric PASSES:** new FdgLab instrument (`probes --feasibility`) shadow-runs the
generator at every real movement decision of benchmark games (JSON-path interception; decision-
neutral - the solo bot still plays): builtin mirror 597/597 activations with a valid non-Hold
candidate, builtin-vs-builtin-basic 464/464 - **100% vs the >= 95% gate**, zero generator
faults. Suite 1509/1509 (4 M11/M12 tests added). Engine `6ad58b5`; lab instrument in the
superproject commit. **Next: A4 (greedy decision policy)** - replace delegated resolvers one
request type at a time, benchmark after each; needs Chris's 2k army pool for meaningful scores.

**2026-07-09 — A3c-1 (MacroActionGenerator, M1-M10) DONE.** `Ai/Tactician/MacroAction.cs` +
`MacroActionGenerator.cs`: goal enumeration per confirmed Appendix A - Hold (always), objective
advance/rush (both budgets), EngageAtRange with the three bands (SafeShooting/kite exists only
when own reach exceeds the enemy's threat envelope; endpoint may open the distance - verified),
ChargeToContact (solo-style explicit-end-gap construction when the lane is clear, path-planner
route otherwise; feasibility graded by ACHIEVED gap), FallBack, SeekCoverFrom (far side of the
nearest Cover piece), Block (LINE spread perpendicular to the LANE via the new lineAxis
parameter - the first draft spread across the approach and the test caught it), Escort
(interpose toward the ward's nearest threat), Concentrate. Every move is ladder-built (G3);
every candidate carries feasibility (Reachable/BudgetClipped/Blocked) + a G12 rationale string.
Diversity-preserving pruning: rank-by-feasibility within family, round-robin across families,
round 0 completes even past the budget (>=1 per family guaranteed - tested at budget 6). Two
planner fixes shaken out by the tests: ClampRepackStep pre-clamp in BuildPathCandidate (first
candidates were over-budget and the ladder halved real moves - Concentrate under-moved), and the
charge construction above. **Verified:** 10 tests incl. the GATING generator-level hallway probe
(objective beyond a 4" corridor -> traversing candidate emitted, >6" progress) and
every-emitted-move-passes-ValidatePaths. Suite 1505/1505; bench hash unchanged (B05AA1D810364C6B,
solo-rules untouched). **Sub-slice split (G7), recorded:** A3c-2 = M11 MoveToCast + M12
DeliverCargo (need casting/transport queries) + the benchmark-sampled >=95% feasibility metric
(shadow-generator instrument in FdgLab). Next after that: A4 greedy policy.

**2026-07-09 — APPENDIX A v2 CONFIRMED by Chris (the A3c gate, plan sec. 5). A3c is go.**
One edit folded in at his direction: mid-game MoveToEmbark cut from M12 (post-deployment
embarking almost never useful - seen once, transport had Flying; revival condition recorded in
the appendix: gate on transport mobility >> cargo mobility). Deploy-time embark stays.
Also decided with him: **benchmark pool = ~8 armies at 2,000 points, uniform** (his argument
carried: real games are 2k+, strategy differs with scale - objective spread vs concentration -
big games pass through small-force regimes as attrition bites, and low-point lists under-sample
novel units). Chris is building the armies now; suggested archetypes given (the sec. 6.1 six +
a transport list + a second-faction repeat). Throughput cost to be measured on the first real
2k army (G6). C-gate rider recorded: one held-out pair at a different point level probes
generalization across game size. Plan doc updated in the same commit (appendix header, M12
entry, sec. 5 trigger marked satisfied, sec. 6.1 pool spec). Bycatch this exchange: Army Forge
gained an editable points limit (was hard-coded 1000; superproject `00132d3`).

**2026-07-09 — A3b (grid pathfinding) DONE.** `Ai/Tactician/GridPathfinder.cs`: `TerrainGrid`
(1" cells over the table, blocked/difficult by degenerate swept-disc tests, inflated by base
radius - the validator's own Minkowski semantics), A* (8-connected, no corner cutting, octile
heuristic, difficult cells x2 as a route PREFERENCE - the rules-true 6" whole-move cap is applied
by the caller), string-pulled polylines, `AdvanceAlongPath` (arc-length walk reporting passed
waypoints + difficult crossings). `MovementPlanner.BuildPathCandidate` (all models share the
path's interior waypoints - the unit funnels through corridors - and fan into Grid/Line formation
at the endpoint; arc length is the ladder's backoff knob) and `PlanMoveToward` (grid -> path ->
difficult cap -> G3 ladder; straight-line fallback when unreachable or flying). Multi-leg
`ModelMoveEntry.Positions` carries the corridor legs, so the engine validates the true route.
**Verified:** 7 authored-terrain tests - straight-when-clear, routes-around-wall (no leg clips
impassible), THREADS THE 4" CORRIDOR (plan D5's canonical failure of angular skirting), sealed
goal -> null (infeasible, not wrong), mid-leg budget stop, difficult-route 6" cap end-to-end,
corridor composition passes MovementUtilities.ValidatePaths and gains >4" toward the goal. Suite
1479/1479; bench hash unchanged (B05AA1D810364C6B - solo-rules untouched, as intended: nothing
calls PlanMoveToward until A3c/A4). Perf note (G6): grid built per query, a few thousand point
tests - optimize only on profiler evidence. NEXT IS THE HARD GATE: Appendix A v2 confirmation
with Chris before A3c (plan sec. 5) - A3c must not start without it.

**2026-07-09 — A3a (MovementPlanner extraction) DONE.** `Ai/Tactician/MovementPlanner.cs`: the
solo-rules move-construction mechanics moved verbatim behind shared primitives - `BuildCandidate`
(single-step vs formation re-pack, with the step<=0 -> StayInPlace degenerate preserved exactly,
dead models' zero-length paths included), `RefineStepTowardGap` (measure-and-correct, 3
iterations), `ValidateWithBackoff` (the G3 ladder: halve to min step -> reform-in-place -> hold
exact), `StayInPlace`/`HoldExactPositions`/`LiveEnemyFootprints`/`MinEnemyGap`, tuning constants.
`AiDefineMovementResolver` keeps only policy (archetype, nearest-enemy targeting, terrain
skirting, difficult-terrain clamp) and delegates the mechanics. NEW: `PackLine` + the
`EFormation {Grid, Line}` flag (Appendix A M8's barrier shape; perpendicular-to-move by default),
with rank-wrap so a long line never breaks the 9" coherency rule.
**Pinned (D1):** the 8 AiDefineMovementResolver tests + 7 CohesiveFormation tests green unchanged;
suite 1472/1472 (+3 PackLine tests); and the decisive instrument - 200-game benchmark outcome
hashes on both matrices, captured fresh immediately before the refactor and re-run after:
builtin `B05AA1D810364C6B`, builtin-basic `F4318EF0D91161F5`, BOTH IDENTICAL pre/post (they also
still match the #198-era values, so #196/#197's parallel landings didn't shift these
trajectories either). Deferred, recorded: `AiConsolidationMoveResolver` still owns its own
consolidation logic - migrate onto the planner only if A4 needs consolidation policy (avoid
speculative churn). Next: A3b (grid pathfinding), then the HARD GATE - Appendix A confirmation
with Chris before A3c.

**2026-07-09 — A2 (TacticalAnalysis) DONE.** `Ai/Tactician/TacticalAnalysis.cs`: mobility queries
(Advance/Rush reuse `MovementRuleQueries`; `ChargeDistanceAgainst` composes the unit's charge
budget + the target-conditioned query exactly as DefinePathStage does - first draft wrongly fed
the BASE charge into the per-target query and the Fast test caught it); `ThreatRangeAgainst`
(max of advance+longest-effective-weapon-range and charge reach - the M4 kite band's input);
`ExpectedShootingAt` (CombatMath at a hypothetical distance/cover); objective projection
(`ProjectObjectives`/`ProjectedScore` mirroring ReconcileObjectivesStage: base-edge distance
within 3", sticky owner, contest-to-neutral, Shaken/reserve-arrival/Aircraft exclusions - the
radius + rules are a MIRROR of that stage's privates, noted in both files); `UnitValue` (runtime
units carry no point cost - UnitFileEntry.PointCost never reaches UnitData - so it is the plan's
f(wounds, quality, weapon output): sqrt(durability x (1+output)) vs a Q4/D4 reference).
**Verified:** 10 tests on authored states - base/Fast move+charge distances, threat ranges,
seize/contest/sticky/edge-distance/exclusion projection cases, value ordering on real HDF stat
lines (Infantry>Recruits, Storm Troopers>Veterans, Tank>all), value falls with casualties. Suite
1462/1462. **Honest calibration note:** the book prices Recruits (10 @ 75) BELOW GRUNT Robots
(5 @ 80) where the formula ranks them the other way - quality is weighted harder by the book than
by this v1; revisit only if A4's value-weighted targeting misreads benchmarks (G2). Special rules
deliberately don't contribute to UnitValue yet (recorded gap).

**2026-07-09 — A1 (CombatMath) DONE.** `Ai/Tactician/CombatMath.cs`: `EstimateShooting` (all
in-range weapon batches), `EstimateMelee` (impact hits, Counter strike-first swap - which also
strips the charger's IsCharging, exactly as the engine's role swap does - swings per weapon batch,
return strikes from survivors only, fatigue, Fear-adjusted resolution margin), `EstimateVolley`
(the pinned core). **Design refinement over the plan (G10 note added to sec. 8):** the "~15 named
rules" became *definition-driven* math - CombatMath mirrors the stages' arithmetic skeleton and
delegates all rule effects to the engine's own `RuleEvaluator.EvaluateAllNamed` (read-only: no
log spam, no one-shot-grant spending) with the same contexts/participants/sinks the stages use.
So the plan's candidates AND their ~hundreds of data-authored clone instances (Lacerate, Crack,
Shred variants, gated "when shooting/in melee" families...) all price themselves identically to
the engine, by construction. ("Poison" from the candidate list does not exist in the engine.)
**Verified:** 60 pin tests (`CombatMathPinTests`) drive the REAL stage chain per case and assert
|delta| <= max(0.05, 2%) - in practice exact: Q2-6 x D2-6 sweep, AP sweep, cover, Reliable,
Stealth both sides of 9", Shielded, Fortified (AP2+AP0), Rending+Regen, Crack, Regeneration,
Unstoppable, Bane, Lacerate, Shred, Surge, Relentless both ranges, Blast cap (big+small unit),
Deadly vs 1W and Tough(3), melee swing, Furious charge-gated both ways, Thrust, Fatigued-token
6s-only, plus composition tests (impact math, Counter flag + charge strip, Fear margin, survivor
return strikes, out-of-range = 0). Mutation-verified: naive Deadly multiply and skipped Bane
reroll each turn their pins red. Suite 1442/1442.
**Coverage table (what prices itself vs what does not):**
- Modeled (sink-folded at the 7 combat hooks): rollModifier, qualityFloor, addExtraHit,
  multiplyHits, perHitSaveModifier, reduceArmorPenetration, reroll(save), addExtraWound,
  multiplyWounds (clump-confined), ignoreWoundOnRoll, ignoreRule, ignoreCover, chargeImpactHits,
  reduceImpactDicePerModel, strikeFirst, extraMeleeWoundCount, setMaxWounds (via stats), fatigue.
- Modeled at runtime IF the caller passes the game's evaluator (token read-back needs its rule
  resolver): aura/addRule-granted rules. A bare evaluator prices static rules only.
- NOT priced (surfaced per-call via `AttackEstimate.Notes` where detectable): granted one-shot
  roll-modifier tokens (engine's only accessor consumes them - a Peek API is an engine-seam ask),
  target Mark claiming (mutates tokens), Takedown priced best-case vs healthiest model,
  per-volley casualty carry-over inside one attack, melee in-range subset (assumes all living
  carriers reach post pile-in), morale/movement/deployment/casting hooks (other slices' scope).
**Deferred, recorded:** book-wide generated attacker/defender matrix sweep (6.3's full form) -
the hand-built matrix covers every core combat rule; the sweep needs app-side book loading and
lands with the FdgLab probe tooling (A2+). Full-MeleeStage composition pin (PileIn geometry etc.)
- component math is stage-pinned; composition is covered by analytic tests.

**2026-07-09 — A0 (Tactician scaffold) DONE.** Phase A begun. Engine: `Ai/Tactician/`
(`TacticianOptions`, `TacticianResolverRegistryFactory` — A0 delegates every request wholesale to
the unmodified solo-rules resolvers), `EAiProfile { SoloRules, Tactician }` + `AiProfileFactory`
(the single profile->AI dispatch; moved the enum from FdgLab into the engine, per plan sec. 3).
App: `--ai-profile <solorules|tactician>` on the headless + `--scenario` paths (lobby selection
stays deferred to A6); FdgLab `smoke --profile-a/--profile-b`; `bench` per-side profile flags
deliberately deferred to A4 (first benchmark that needs them). Verified per plan A0: new
`TacticianScaffoldTests` (rich armies, seed 24601: Tactician game == solo-rules game, fingerprint
equality; plus self-reproducibility) — suite 1382/1382; seeded headless CLI transcripts
solo-vs-tactician byte-identical modulo per-run PlayerID GUIDs on BOTH a completing seed (42,
4 rounds) and a faulting one (5150); lab smoke tactician-vs-tactician matches solorules exactly.
Test-fixture refactor: shared `Tests/Doubles/TestArmies.cs` + `GameFingerprints.cs` extracted from
DeterminismTests (pure move). Bycatch: **#199 filed** (AutoFill faults on a ~0.0555 fractional
wound, deterministic at seed 31415, profile-independent) and a **deterministic #159 repro** (piped
headless seed 5150, noted in #159 — points at the CLI AutoAdvance as a submitter). Next: A1
CombatMath.

**2026-07-09 — #198 fixed same day; P3 (#194) gate now 3/3, all prerequisites COMPLETE.** Root cause
was a single unseeded `new System.Random()` in `PlaceTerrainStage`'s auto-layout thinning (Chris
called the terrain theory; the async-race suspicion was a red herring). Found via FdgLab's new
`GameTracer` (position-write trace interleaved with the log). Every determinism instrument now
agrees: 200-game bench hashes identical across runs on both army sets, rich-army engine test
(mutation-verified) pins it, seeded CLI runs byte-identical. **Phase B's replayable-rollout
prerequisite is met early** - the B0 spike no longer carries #198 risk. Also: zero #159 faults in
1,200 deterministic games (see #159 - old crash trajectories were fed by random zone terrain).
The ladder is clear: next is Phase A (A0 Tactician scaffold), per plan sec. 8.

**2026-07-09 — P3 (#194) shipped; gate 2/3.** FdgLab exists and works: 200-game seeded matrix in 38s
Debug (**5.25 games/s, ~450k games/day** at DOP 16 — comfortably above the plan's Phase C/D
assumptions), zero hangs, exactly symmetric mirror results, faults ~0.5-1% (all = #159, for which the
harness found an 8/10 seeded repro: `fdglab smoke --seed 1027 --repeat 10`). The harness's first real
catch is **#198**: seeded games are NOT run-to-run deterministic on rich army paths (movement paths
differ; ambush arrival flips) — #193 covered RNGs, but something timing- or identity-hash-ordered
remains. Consequences for the ladder: **Phase A can proceed** (win-rate statistics are unbiased noise;
the bench outcome hash simply won't match between runs yet), but **#198 must close before Phase B**
(search rollouts must replay exactly) — slot it with or before the B0 spike, which was already going
to stare at the same async-void plumbing. Baseline solo-rules-vs-solo-rules report archived in
`FdgLab/reports/` conventions; builtin mirror A-score 50.0% exact.

**2026-07-09 — P2 (#193) done, archived.** Determinism is now a tested engine invariant: same seed +
same build => identical game, and that holds with 16 games running concurrently in one process (the
cross-talk detector plan sec. 6.4 asked for). #194's benchmark can therefore trust its aggregates on
day one, which is why the order was swapped. Three things worth carrying into #194:
(1) **AI seeds key on slot ID, not PlayerID** — GUIDs are per-run; `GameRunner`'s `GameSpec` must pass
`(seed, slotID)` the same way, or seeded benchmarks silently drift.
(2) **Benchmark fingerprints must include objectives**, not just models. The solo-rules bot ignores
objectives, so a model-only comparison is blind to objective-placement nondeterminism (a mutation test
proved it). Same trap will apply to any FdgLab state hashing.
(3) **#195 filed and now fixed** (engine `a19e6ab`): resumed games played four MORE rounds instead of
finishing the four-round game. Resume is now round-count-correct, so Phase B's `SimulationService` and
the scenario probes can rely on it. Remaining prereq: #194.

**2026-07-09 — P1 (#192) done, archived.** Engine `9b1c0ba`. `GameResult` + `FDGServer.OnGameCompleted`
land the reward/benchmark signal the whole ladder depends on. Two findings worth carrying forward:
(1) the default headless game ends `Tie` with `scores=[0, 0]` because **all four objectives stay
neutral all game** — neither the CLI-EOF player nor the solo-rules bot ever moves within 3". That is
the baseline #191 exists to beat, and it means early benchmarks will be tie-heavy until Phase A's
objective awareness lands; the `score = wins + 0.5 * ties` metric (plan G4) already handles this, but
expect low signal from A0/A1 comparisons. (2) `EGameOutcome.Fault` is now emitted by the disconnect
and engine-fault paths, so #194's watchdog can distinguish a real tie from a broken game for free.
Remaining prereqs: #193, #194.

**2026-07-09 — Appendix A v2.** Chris reviewed the vocabulary and contributed seven plays:
bodyguard/escort, kite, mass (death ball), fatigue bait, block, move-to-cast, transport delivery.
Integrated as: new intents M9 Escort / M10 Concentrate / M11 MoveToCast / M12 DeliverCargo+
MoveToEmbark; kite folded into M4 as the SafeShooting band; ScreenLane generalized into M8
Block(e, asset); fatigue bait became the generator-wide *diversity-preserving pruning* rule
(sacrificial candidates must survive to be searched) rather than an intent. New implementation
flags: line-formation mode for the formation packer (A3a), fatigue in CombatMath features (A1) +
concentration features (C1), verify whether Cast permits same-activation movement (A5). v2
awaits Chris's confirmation of the refined form before A3c (see plan sec. 5).

**2026-07-09 — filed.** Plan authored during the Fable window from a three-agent codebase
exploration (existing AI map, engine interface assessment, special-rules variance) + hardware
check. Signed off: new-option-not-replacement, engine-side bot, in-repo FdgLab, Python+ONNX,
search-over-macro-actions with ML as evaluation. Next actions: (1) Chris edits Appendix A
vocabulary; (2) fresh-session dry-run review of the plan doc for ambiguity; (3) Chris curates
the benchmark army pool (~8 armies, archetype spread); (4) start #192/#193/#194.

## Outcome

(open)
