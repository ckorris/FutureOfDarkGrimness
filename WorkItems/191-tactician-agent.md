# 191 — Tactician: challenge-level game-playing AI (umbrella)

**Goal:** an AI opponent that genuinely challenges human players with any army vs any army,
built as a ladder of shippable bots: evaluation-driven heuristics (A) -> MCTS over macro-actions
(B) -> learned value function (C) -> optional self-improvement loop (D).

**Design authority:** `docs/ai-agent-plan.md` — architecture, standing decisions (D1-D6),
invariants (G1-G12), stop-and-ask triggers, per-slice specs, gates, and the macro-action
vocabulary (Appendix A, awaiting Chris's edit). This file is the running ledger; the plan doc is
the spec. Keep both current (plan G10).

**Prerequisites:** #192 (structured game result), #193 (determinism/seeding), #194 (FdgLab
harness). Order: any, but all three before Phase A. Related: #066 (AI resolver legality tests),
#168 (rule-load diagnostics surfacing), #170 (solo-rules deploy packing — baseline hygiene).

**Standing authorizations (Chris, 2026-07-09):** engine submodule modification within
`Ai/Tactician/` + the named P/B seams; new project `FdgLab/` in this repo; Python+ONNX stack.
Solo-rules bot behavior is frozen (benchmark baseline) — refactors sharing its machinery need
pin tests.

## Notes (newest first)

**2026-07-09 — Appendix A v2.** Chris reviewed the vocabulary and contributed seven plays:
bodyguard/escort, kite, mass (death ball), fatigue bait, block, move-to-cast, transport delivery.
Integrated as: new intents M9 Escort / M10 Concentrate / M11 MoveToCast / M12 DeliverCargo+
MoveToEmbark; kite folded into M4 as the SafeShooting band; ScreenLane generalized into M8
Block(e, asset); fatigue bait became the generator-wide *diversity-preserving pruning* rule
(sacrificial candidates must survive to be searched) rather than an intent. New implementation
flags: line-formation mode for the formation packer (A3a), fatigue in CombatMath features (A1) +
concentration features (C1), verify whether Cast permits same-activation movement (A5). v2
awaits Chris's confirmation of the refined form before A3c (see plan sec. 5).

**2026-07-09 — filed.** Plan authored during the Fable window from a three-agent codebase
exploration (existing AI map, engine interface assessment, special-rules variance) + hardware
check. Signed off: new-option-not-replacement, engine-side bot, in-repo FdgLab, Python+ONNX,
search-over-macro-actions with ML as evaluation. Next actions: (1) Chris edits Appendix A
vocabulary; (2) fresh-session dry-run review of the plan doc for ambiguity; (3) Chris curates
the benchmark army pool (~8 armies, archetype spread); (4) start #192/#193/#194.
